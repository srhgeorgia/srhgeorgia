## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sarah!


Cat mom and front-end developer for almost two years.

<hr>

I currently work with the React framework, combining Typescript, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Styled Components, Material UI, Sass, Node, API, AWS, Docker, projects on GitHub and Bitbucket, Scrum and Kanban, and code versioning with GIT.
I also study other Frameworks such as Angular and Vue, and have knowledge in UI and UX.
I want to work as a Full Stack Developer, and for this reason I have knowledge of Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and study Python.
